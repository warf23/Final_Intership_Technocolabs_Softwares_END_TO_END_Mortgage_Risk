# Final_Intership_TechnoLabs_END_TO_END_Mortgage_Risk 💡 



This repository contains the code and resources for deploying a machine learning project end-to-end. The project is implemented using Python 3.10.

## Setting up the Environment

To set up the required environment, follow these steps:

1. Install Anaconda or Miniconda, if not already installed.

2. Create a virtual environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda create -p Intershipvenv python==3.10.9 -y
   ```

   This command creates a virtual environment named `venv` with Python version 3.10.9

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   conda activate Intershipvenv
   ```

   This command activates the `Intershipvenv` virtual environment.
   
## Ignoring Virtual Environment

To avoid including your virtual environment in version control, create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory of your project if it doesn't already exist. Then, add the following line to the `.gitignore` file:

```plaintext
/venv/
```
